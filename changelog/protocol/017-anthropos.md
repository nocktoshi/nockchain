# Anthropos

## Summary

Anthropos activates ZK proof version `%5` at block height 147,500. Version `%5`
keeps full hardened STARK verification but moves the ZK nonce lottery to a
Tip5 digest of proof object `0`, then recalibrates dual-puzzle fork-choice work
and ASERT intervals for 70% AI-PoW / 30% ZK-PoW.

Proof version `%4` remains the AI-PoW artifact discriminator. It is not a ZK
proof version and its verifier, mining kernel, and proof encoding do not change.

## Motivation

ZK proof versions `%0` through `%3` derive their mining digest from proof
objects `0` through `6`. A miner must therefore regenerate the complete proof
before it can test another nonce. Version `%5` separates those jobs:
evaluate proof object `0` and its Tip5 digest for each nonce, then construct one
complete proof only after a nonce meets the target.

That changes the hardware unit represented by one ZK attempt. The Logos
exchange rate compared Pearl MAC throughput with complete ZK proof throughput;
Anthropos instead compares Pearl MAC throughput with public RTX 5090 Tip5
hash-grinding throughput. The block allocation also changes from Logos's 30%
AI / 70% ZK target to 70% AI / 30% ZK while retaining the approximately 150 s
combined cadence.

## Technical Specification

### Proof-version schedule

Consensus selects the ZK proof version from block height as follows:

```text
height < 6,750                 -> %0
6,750 <= height < 12,000      -> %1
12,000 <= height < 119,400    -> %2
119,400 <= height < 147,500   -> %3
height >= 147,500             -> %5
```

`%4` remains reserved for structured AI-PoW artifacts. ZK encoders, decoders,
miners, and verifiers reject `%4` rather than interpreting it as a ZK proof.

### Version `%5` proof and mining digest

Version `%5` uses the version `%3` AIR, preprocessing tables, proof-object
sequence, canonical encodings, hardened DEEP post-commitment equation, Merkle
authentication, and FRI verification.

The submitted `%puzzle` object retains its actual nonce. The `%5` prover and
verifier use that nonce when evaluating the puzzle statement and when absorbing
object `0` into the Fiat-Shamir transcript. The complete proof is therefore
bound to the winning nonce and cannot be reused for another nonce. Miners can
still evaluate object `0` and its mining digest before constructing the
remaining proof objects.

The mining projection hashes the raw submitted object `0` and discards objects
`1` through `6`:

```text
object-0 = %puzzle [block-commitment actual-nonce len p]
pow-v5   = Tip5([leaf+%zkpow-v5 hash+hash-proof([%5 [object-0] ~ 0])])
```

The winning digest therefore remains bound to the candidate block, actual
nonce, and puzzle result. Mutating the nonce changes `pow-v5` and invalidates
the proof. Mutating any suffix object does not change `pow-v5` or the v5 block
ID. Objects after object `0` are a mandatory witness envelope: invalid suffixes
fail admission, while alternate accepted suffixes identify the same semantic
block and contribute work only once.

For `%5`, `hash-proof-for-block` hashes the version and the object-`0` mining
projection under the `%zkblk-v5` domain. The page digest separately includes the
candidate block commitment, so the resulting block ID is bound to both the full
candidate contents and the exact target-qualifying work object without assuming
that a valid STARK witness is unique. Versions `%0` through `%3` retain their
historical block-ID rules.

### Height-gated cross-puzzle work

A block contributes expected work at its own target. ZK work remains
`(p^5 - 1)/(target+1)`. AI work is `2^256/(target+1)` MAC-equivalents divided by
the exchange rate selected for that block height.

Historical Logos blocks retain their original rate:

```text
height < 147,500: 25,750,000,000 MAC / complete-proof attempt
```

For version `%5`, the reference RTX 5090 rates are 400 TMAC/s for Pearl and
388.8 Mguess/s for post-hardfork Tip5 grinding. The latter is public
Neptune Cash/OXZD miner data: <https://useneptune.org/faq/#mining>.

```text
400,000,000,000,000 / 388,800,000 = 1,028,806.584...
height >= 147,500: 1,028,807 MAC / Tip5 hash
```

The quotient is rounded to the nearest integer. The height gate is mandatory:
replacing the Logos value retroactively would change historical accumulated
work and fork choice.

### 70% AI / 30% ZK ASERT allocation

At height 147,500, both per-puzzle ASERT lineages re-anchor to the median
timestamp of block 147,499 and reset their virtual counts. Their ideal
inter-block times become:

```text
AI-PoW: 214 seconds
ZK-PoW: 500 seconds
```

The steady-state shares are:

```text
AI = (1/214) / (1/214 + 1/500) = 70.028%
ZK = (1/500) / (1/214 + 1/500) = 29.972%
combined interval = 1 / (1/214 + 1/500) = 149.86 seconds
```

The version `%5` ASERT lanes use independent reference-network capacities:

```text
ZK-PoW: 2,000 RTX 5090s * 388,800,000 Tip5 hashes/s
      = 777,600,000,000 Tip5 hashes/s
AI-PoW: 10 ExaMAC/s
      = 10,000,000,000,000,000,000 MAC/s
```

The resulting consensus anchor targets are:

```text
ZK = floor((p^5 - 1) / (777,600,000,000 * 500))
   = 5493793810273389665851259858908398676672107719039465617368341183437285024349963580
AI = floor(2^256 / (10,000,000,000,000,000,000 * 214))
   = 54108452914633736179238778041442947594985974142822693476
```

After integer flooring, the anchors contribute 777,599,999,999 ZK and
9,719,996,073,121 AI normalized work units per second. These independent
capacity assumptions intentionally make the AI rate about 12.5 times the ZK
rate. The cross-puzzle conversion remains 1,028,807 MAC per Tip5 hash.

### Unchanged rules

Anthropos does not change AI-PoW `%4`, the STARK AIR, transaction or note
encoding, emissions, the 80/20 miner/protocol-fund split, or any block below
height 147,500.

## Activation

- **Height**: `147500`
- **Coordination**: Nodes and both miner types must deploy the Anthropos release
  before the activation boundary. ZK miners must emit `%5` proofs beginning with
  block 147,500; `%3` is rejected at and after that height.

The dynamic ASERT timestamp cache accepts block 147,499 directly as the anchor,
so a node upgraded while parked at the predecessor does not need to replay it.

## Migration

### Requirements

- Node and miner software containing protocol version `0.1.17`.
- ZK mining software capable of encoding `%5` and grinding the object-`0` Tip5
  digest.

### Configuration

None. Activation height, exchange rates, ideal intervals, and anchor targets are
consensus constants.

### Data Migration

None. The derived per-puzzle ASERT counters reset deterministically when block
147,500 is accepted. Existing blocks, proofs, accumulated-work values, and
transaction state are retained.

### Steps

1. Stop block production before height 147,500 if the node or miner has not been
   upgraded.
2. Deploy the Anthropos node release to validators and both miner types.
3. Confirm ZK miners advertise proof version `%5` for candidate height 147,500.
4. Monitor the first post-activation ZK and AI targets, proof rejection reasons,
   and observed per-puzzle cadence.

### Rollback

Do not roll back to a pre-Anthropos binary after accepting block 147,500. It
will derive `%3`, use the Logos exchange rate and ASERT schedule, and split from
the upgraded chain.

## Backward Compatibility

This is a height-gated consensus break. Old nodes reject `%5` ZK proofs and
compute different post-activation targets and accumulated work. Old ZK miners
continue producing `%3`, which upgraded nodes reject at height 147,500.

Pre-activation proofs and blocks remain valid under their historical version,
work exchange rate, and ASERT schedule. Wallet and transaction formats do not
change.

## Security Considerations

- Full proof verification remains mandatory. The shortened mining projection is
  not a shortened proof and does not bypass transcript, Merkle, DEEP, or FRI
  checks.
- Proof object `0` includes the candidate block commitment and nonce. The
  commitment covers the parent and all candidate contents except `.pow`, so
  sibling candidates sharing one parent derive different work from the same raw
  nonce and cannot reuse its winning digest or proof.
- For `%5`, `hash-proof-for-block` commits the `%5` domain, version, and object-0
  mining projection. Both page encodings include that digest and the candidate
  commitment in the block ID. Suffix mutations therefore cannot create new
  block identities or duplicate work, while invalid suffixes still fail full
  proof verification.
- A failed `%5` witness is attributed to the sending peer rather than poisoning
  the shared block ID. A later valid envelope for the same object `0` remains
  admissible; after one valid envelope is accepted, ordinary block-ID duplicate
  handling collapses all alternates.
- `%4` is not accepted by the ZK codec. This preserves an unambiguous wire-level
  distinction between AI-PoW and ZK-PoW.
- The old work rate remains active below height 147,500. Historical chainwork is
  therefore invariant under the upgrade.

## Operational Impact

For each `%5` nonce, a ZK miner evaluates the block-bound `%puzzle` object and
checks its Tip5 digest against the target. A miss returns immediately. Only
after a nonce meets the target does the miner construct and submit one complete
proof for that exact nonce. Pools must update job/version negotiation and must
not submit `%3` at or after activation.

Operators should monitor the first `%5` block, invalid-version and invalid-proof
rates, both ASERT targets, and convergence toward the 70% AI / 30% ZK target.
The combined target cadence remains approximately 150 seconds.

## Testing and Validation

- Hoon proof tests pin that changing object `1` leaves `%5` PoW and both page
  encodings' block IDs unchanged, while changing object `0` changes both.
  The Roswell proving scenario additionally verifies that the preflight object
  exactly matches the complete proof's object `0` and that changing its nonce
  invalidates the proof.
- Rust codec tests pin `%5` noun round trips and canonical array encoding.
- Rust verifier and transcript tests pin that `%5` preserves the `%3`
  nonce-bound statement and that Fiat-Shamir absorbs the actual mining nonce.
- The reference-miner worker test rejects a losing nonce before full proof
  construction, proves a winning nonce once, and verifies the submitted proof
  natively.
- Consensus boundary tests pin `%3` immediately before height 147,500, `%5` at
  and after it, and `%4` as AI-only.
- Dual-puzzle tests pin the historical/new exchange-rate boundary, the new ASERT
  rows, requested capacity anchors, and their exact normalized work rates.
